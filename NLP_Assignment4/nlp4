The goal is to build a Transformer model that can process sequential data (like text) using self-attention mechanisms. This transformer can be used for tasks like machine translation, text generation, and sequence modeling.The model takes a sequence of tokens (words or subwords), processes them using attention mechanisms, and outputs predictions for each token (e.g., for translation or language modeling).

The implementation includes the following key components:
(1) Positional Encoding
ðŸš€ Why Do We Need Positional Encoding?
Transformers do not have built-in recurrence (like RNNs) or sequence order (like CNNs). So, we add positional encodings to provide information about the position of each word in the input sequence.
âœ… How Does the Code Work?
It calculates sine and cosine functions at different frequencies.
This helps encode the position of tokens in a continuous manner.

(2) Multi-Head Self-Attention
ðŸš€ What is Self-Attention?
Self-attention helps a word attend to all other words in a sentence. It assigns different importance scores to different words based on their relevance.
âœ… How Does the Code Work?
qkv_linear: Creates Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) from input.
scores = (Q @ Káµ€) / sqrt(d_k): Computes similarity scores between words.
F.softmax(scores, dim=-1): Normalizes the scores using softmax.
attn @ v: Generates weighted representations.

(3) Feed Forward Network (FFN)
Each transformer layer contains a position-wise feed-forward network to process the output of self-attention.
âœ… How Does the Code Work?
Uses a 2-layer MLP with ReLU activation.
Helps in learning complex transformations.

(4) Transformer Encoder Layer
Each encoder layer consists of:
Multi-Head Self-Attention
Feed-Forward Network
Layer Normalization & Residual Connections
âœ… How Does the Code Work?
Layer Normalization ensures numerical stability.
Dropout helps in regularization.

(5) Transformer Model
The final Transformer model consists of:
Embedding Layer (converts words to vectors)
Positional Encoding (adds positional information)
Stacked Encoder Layers (processes the sequence)
Final Fully Connected Layer (produces output predictions)
âœ… How Does the Code Work?
Stacked Encoder Layers (self.layers) form the deep network.
Final Layer (fc_out) converts to vocabulary size for classification.


Running the Model
1. Creates a random input sequence of 10 tokens.
2. Passes it through the Transformer.
3. Outputs a tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size).

Summary
We implemented: âœ… Positional Encoding (adds order info)
âœ… Multi-Head Self-Attention (focuses on important words)
âœ… Feed-Forward Network (learns transformations)
âœ… Stacked Transformer Layers (deep processing)
âœ… End-to-End Transformer ModelThis is a basic Transformer model and can be extended for tasks like machine translation or text generation. ðŸš€
